# Introduction

Welcome to the Best Practices guide for Veeam Backup & Replication.

## About This Guide

This guide is developed by Veeam architects, and its content is also validated
by support, developers and QA departments to ensure highest possible quality. If
you have any questions or comments, please reach out the authors directly, or
via your local Veeam Software representative.

Keep in mind this book is optimized for digital consumption, and the most recent version is always
available on [veeambp.com](https://www.veeambp.com).


## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for backup administrators or consultants managing Veeam
Backup & Replication on a daily basis.

Most sections of this guide assume you already have hands on experience with
Backup & Replication, and will serve as an "advanced user guide", meaning
that more basic usage information, system requirements and the like must be
found in [User Guide in Veeam Helpcenter](https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html).


The book is broken into two sections which is a change from our original format, the two sections provide (section 1) a short Best Practice explanation and (Section 2) and more detailed look at the information, hopefully this will give both a quick find or longer read whichever suits your needs or time.

Service providers delivering BaaS and DRaaS with Veeam Cloud Connect should
refer to the corresponding
[Veeam Cloud Connect Book](https://www.vccbook.io/) or [Veeam Cloud Connect Reference Architecture](https://www.veeam.com/wp-cloud-connect-reference-architecture-v9.html).
